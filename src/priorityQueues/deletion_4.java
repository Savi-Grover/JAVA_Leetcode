 * Dequeue / Delete
1. Copy the value at the root of the heap to the variable used to return a value.
2. Copy the last element of the heap to the root, and then reduce the size of heap by 1. This
element is called the "out-of-place" element.
3. Restore heap property by swapping the out-of-place element with its greatest-value child.
Repeat this process until the out-of-place element reaches a leaf or it has a value that is
greater or equal to all its children.
4. Return the answer that was saved in Step 1
