Relationship amoung classes
These are the various relationships that exist between two classes:

1. Dependency: Objects of one class use objects of another class temporarily. When a class creates
an instance of another class inside its member method and use it and when the method exits, then
the instance of the othe r class is deleted.

2. Association: Objects of one class work with objects of another class for some amount of time.
The association is of two kinds - Aggregation and Composition.

2 a. Aggregation: One class object share a reference to objects of another class. When a class stores
the reference of another class inside it. Just a reference is kept inside the class.

2 b. Composition: One class contains objects of another class. In Composition, the containing object
is responsible for the creation and deletion of the contained object.

3. Inheritance: One class is a sub-type of another class. Inheritance is a straightforward
relationship to explain the parent-child relationship.


//inheritance
public class AdvanceBulb extends Bulb {
	int intensity;
	public void setIntersity(int i) {
	intensity = i;
	}
}

//General Prototype of a child Class
class ChildClass extends ParentClass implements SomeInterface {
// fields
// methods
}
