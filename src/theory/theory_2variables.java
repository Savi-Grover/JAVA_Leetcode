		Data Types
		The various types of variable are defined as Data Types. There are two varieties of data types
		available in JAVA:
		1. Primitive/ Basic Data Types
		2. Reference Data Types

		//constants
		/*
		Constants are defined by using static modifier in combination with the final modifier.
		The final modifier indicates that the value of this field cannot be changed. The static modifier
		indicates that there will be only one instance of the variable and is a class variable.
		For example, the following variable declaration defines a constant named PI, whose value
		approximates pi.
		
		static final double PI = 3.141592653589793;
		
		Another example, in this we had created a constant of string type.
		static final String text = "Hello, World!";
