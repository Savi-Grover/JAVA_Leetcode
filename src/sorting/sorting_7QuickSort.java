/*
 * Quick sort is also a recursive algorithm.
 In each step we select a pivot ( let us say first element of array).
 Then we traverse the rest of the array and copy all the elements of the array which are
smaller than the pivot to the left side of array
 We copy all the elements of the array which are grater then pivot to the right side of the array.
Obviously the pivot is at its sorted position.
 Then we sort the left and right subarray separately.
 When the algorithm returns the whole array is sorted.

The space required by Quick-Sort is very less, only O(nlogn) additional space is required.

 Quicksort is not a stable sorting technique, so it might change the occurrence of two similar
elements in the list while sorting.
Complexity Analysis:

space  time - O(nlogn)
