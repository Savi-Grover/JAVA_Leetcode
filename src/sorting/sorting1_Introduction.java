/*
 * SORTING- orders elements in increasing or decreasing order
 * 
 * why- so that searching of element becomes easy.
 * 
 * 
 * based on dataset quantity - sort can be based on 2 types:
 * 1. small dataset- bubble, insertion, selection
 * 2. large  dataset- heap, quick, mergeS
 * 
 * usually in sorting - we use 2 comparison function - 
 * 
 * 1. less function - used to get decreasing/descending order
 * 
 * Less function will return 1 if value1 is less than value2 otherwise, it will return 0.
 * 
private boolean less(int value1, int value2)
{
return value1 < value2;
}

 * 
 * 2. more function - used for getting increasing/ascending order
 * More function will return 1 if value1 is more than value2 otherwise it will return 0.
private boolean more(int value1, int value2)
{
return value1 > value2;
}

 * Type of Sorting
Internal Sorting: All the elements can be read into memory at the same time and sorting is
performed in memory.
	1. Selection-Sort
	2. Insertion-Sort
	3. Bubble-Sort
	4. Quick-Sort
External Sorting: In this, the dataset is so big that it is impossible to load the whole dataset into
memory so sorting is done in chunks.
	1. Merge-Sort
	
Three things to consider in choosing, sorting algorithms for application:
	1. Number of elements in list
	2. A number of different orders of list required
	3. The amount of time required to move the data or not move the data
